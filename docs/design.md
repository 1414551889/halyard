## Problem

Currently, it is not easy to setup and operate non-trivial installations of
[Spinnaker](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker). It requires knowledge of
the behavior and operation of many independently configured services. Even with
that knowledge, there is no existing solution for distributing or valdating
configuration, updating Spinnaker's stateful services, or interacting with
Spinnaker's API endpoint outside of the prebuilt UI. The goal of Halyard is to
fix all of this. To understand what Halyard will become, and how it will
address these problems, we will separate the concerns of Halyard into three
pieces.

1. [Configuring Spinnaker](#configuring-spinnaker)

2. [Deploying and Updating Spinnaker](#deploying-and-updating-spinnaker)

3. [Interacting with a Deployed Spinnaker
   Installation](#interacting-with-a-deployed-spinnaker-installation)
